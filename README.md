## Wazuh Indexer Security Analytics Plugin

The OpenSearch Security Analytics aims to enable you to run security operations by automating threat detection and threat analysis on your data. Security analytics plugin will include a threat detection engine that will be pre-loaded with a set of detection rules, that you can customize and extend to alert on standard or custom attack patterns.

### Highlights

* This open-source framework for analyzing the security events will address the cost and complexity associated with running the security operations on your business and infrastructure data.
* It will enable you to monitor your data, generate findings and send alert notifications automatically to your stakeholders.
* The security analytics dashboards will let you manage your threats, correlate events and take remediation actions.
